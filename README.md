# First steps for Graph Neural Networks

This git is setup as an answer to the graph related peer questions that I have heard and seen during the course GenAI assignment 'answer a peer question'. For multiple reasons I haven't succeeded in creating some basic GraphRAG proof of concept, and I wasn't able to think up a Graph Convolutional layer on my own at this moment, so I have put some effort into this git starter repo on GNNs. It is especially accessible for people that don't have a clue on what GNNs are all about.

In the Jupyter notebook [pdf](https://github.com/wilfred11/gnn-first-steps/blob/main/gnns-initial-steps.ipynb) some first steps into the world of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are presented. A pdf [pdf](https://github.com/wilfred11/gnn-first-steps/blob/main/genai-wvc-assign2_.pdf)  is present to get a broader idea of GNNs an their purpose. It is basically just an introduction into it. I haven't really added anything new to the world, I just aggregated and presented dispersed information.
