# First steps for Graph Neural Networks

In this Jupyter notebook I have made some first steps into the world of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). A pdf [pdf](https://github.com/wilfred11/gnn-first-steps/blob/main/genai-wvc-assign2_.pdf)  is present to get a broader idea of GNNs. It is basically just an introduction into it. I haven't really added anything just aggregated dispersed information.
